			<h3>The User Testing</h3>
			<div class = "well">
				<h4>Why is the User Important?</h4>
				Because it's all about the user! User testing and their respective feedback is very important in the design process. This is how we know to fit our deisgn to the user's needs. To test our prototypes, we drafted a script, telling the user what to do in various situations and observed their behaviors. We found themes in their feedback and incorporated many of these into our design.
				<h4>Testing the initial Confusion Scale</h4>The initial design that I tested was the Confusion Scale. When I asked my classmates to evaluate the design, they said that they found it very intuitive to use. The only problem that came up is that everybody has a different definition of "confusion". For example, a "5" of confusion for someone might be a "7" of confusion for someone else, so that might be hard for the professor to interpret and they might abandon the design altogether.
				<h4>Testing the Prototype</h4>
				Our team made an interactive Flash prototype of our product, and tested it among our classmates.
				Our users thought that the use of "archive" was deceptive because they thought that it was a collection of questions that the user, themselves, had previously asked. When we let the users explore the application for themselves, many went straight for the search bar. Instead of typing in questions, themselves, they found themselves typing in Keywords. We thought about this, and realized that this makes sense, because when most people use Google, they would type in fragments of sentences as opposed to the entire sentence they were searching for. Our users suggested that we add dates and timestamps to each question asked. We thought this was a great idea, and so we incorporated this feedback into our fianl prototype.  
				<h4>Testing the User</h4>
				In addition to asking classmates and other college students for their opinions, we went ahead and created personas for people who might use the product as well. For example, there might be a girl who came from an incredibly small high school, and is scared by the large lecture halls here, at the University of Washington. Or perhaps somebody who is incredibly busy playing sports, is falling quickly behind in class--and doesn't want to "sound stupid" during class.
