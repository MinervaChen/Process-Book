			<h3>The Final Solution</h3>
			<div class = "well"> 
			<h4>The Changes</h4>Many changes have happened since the first prototype. We added some features, and deleted some features. We added a side bar, a search bar, color coordinated the text boxes, and reorganized the layout to look friendly and approachable. We recognize that many of those who might use the Question Master are stressed in that moment, and would appreciate a layout that was easy and inviting. And so, we went for a "warm" sort of feel. We wanted it to be fun and colorful.
			<h4>The Question Master</h4>
			Finally, this is the question Master. Here is a flow chart of the program. ADD PICTURES!!!
			<h4>Some Final Thoughts</h4>
			We have given The Question Master a lot of thought, and we acknowledge that it might be distracting for some people to have such an application to use during class. Perhaps some professors would not allow electronics to be used, so The Question Master is not used in that situation. The Question Master might not satisfy every students' needs, but it does have a lot of functionality that would help those who are uncomfortable raising their voice in a large lecture hall. 
			<h4>The Video Prototype</h4>
			Check out The Question Master in action!
