			<h3> The Problem Statement</h3>
			<div class = "well"> 
			<h4>My Team</h4> When I first met my team, I knew we would have a lot of fun. Everybody was enthusiastic and we stayed on task when we needed to be. It was fun!
			<h4>My Reflection</h4>The most difficult part about the design process was coming up with many solutions, and being able to narrow the solution down to a feasible product that the user would become satisfied with. Personally, the most difficult aspect for me was coming up with a large amount of ideas quickly without getting too stuck on one idea. I feel like it is all too easy to become too attached to one idea, and want to get into details on how the idea would be implemented and all the wonderful things that could come out it. For instance, I came up an idea of a confusion scale that a student would be able to slide up and down; this data would be collected in real-time and the professor teaching a class would be able to know whether or not to slow down his lecture slides, etc. I instantly became very attached to this idea and wanted to expand upon it. This made it difficult to come up different solutions to solve our problem statement. In fact, I became so attached to the idea, that for a while, it was difficult to see that this solution didn’t quite fit in with our problem state, which was “how can we address the issue of students becoming too afraid to ask questions during class?”.

			The issue of becoming too attached to one idea, when coming up with solutions was easily more bearable while working in a team of people. Other members of the group came up with different solutions, and when it came time to, we decided to combine each of our favorite ideas into one solution; a web application that had a chat room, ability to ask and vote questions up and down for popularity, and a confusion scale. So at the very least, our final collection of ideas would address the problem statement. It was easier to deal with the issue of becoming too attached to one idea also because my other group members would come up with different ideas as well, so of course, I would come up with my share of ideas; I didn’t want to be the one to only have a couple ideas when we were cumulatively supposed to come out with fifty ideas.  

			If I could redo my project, I think we should have come up with more problem statements. Initially, we spent a lot of time finding a solution first, and then figuring out what problem it would solve instead of the other way around. Doing things from this order got us sidetracked a lot, and stuck on several ideas. So I would probably try to be vaguer to start with, when it came to the problem statement and solutions, and narrow it down as we went along. Another thing I would change is to each come up with more sketches of what we envisioned the complete application to look like. I think when we designed the application digitally, we drew it out together—but I think it would be interesting what we could each come up with on our own.
