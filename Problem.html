			<h3> The Problem Statement</h3>
			<div class = "well"> 
			<a href="http://www.esriblog.info/engaging-with-challenging-theory/confused-student-e1350394401788/"> <img class = "picl" src="img/problem2.jpg" alt="problem2" height="420" width="350"></a>
			<h4>This was the beginning.</h4> Our team began by thinking of many issues that a college student might come accross. Our initial choices were that carpooling was difficult to find, that it was difficult to get from one side
			of campus to another, and that dorm food tasted nasty etc. Eventually, we decided upon the issue that it was difficult for many students to raise their hands during class. We addressed this question specifically, "How can college students be in an environment where they will feel comfortable asking questions in a large lecture setting?"
			<h4>Is this a real issue?</h4> Upon our decision, we decided to do some research to legitimize our problem statement. We discovered that one of the main reasons why students do not participate in class is because “many are shy or afraid to raise their hands”, -<a href="http://teachingcenter.wustl.edu/strategies/Pages/increasing-participation.aspx">'The Teaching Center'</a>. Furthermore, according to <a href="http://info.lecturetools.com/blog/bid/39488/How-Technology-Empowers-the-Shy-Student-to-Participate-in-Class">'The Lecture Tools'</a>, “students are unlikely to answer a question if they fear their peers will judge them based on their answer”.

			<h4>Is this an issue for our demographic?</h4> Individually, our group members set out to interview other college students about this issue. After interviewing some students, I discovered that not all college students think the same way. Some found it incredibly difficult to ask questions in class, and others didn't care whether or not they got heard. This shows that although it is more difficult to ask questions in large lectures, not everybody believes that this problem directly inhibits their learning. </br> However, if we are solely looking at this problem, we find that there are many people who are too scared and insecure to ask questions in large lectures. This kind of fear could easily lead to confusion about the course material. Furthermore, the teacher would not know the class is confused in the first place if nobody asks questions. This changed my understanding of the design problem, because now we knew that even though this issue is a valid problem that people struggle with, it is not widely considered an “extremely big deal”. This means that when we attempt to create solutions, we should not have the solution drastically change the way large lectures are done in general, but create a subtle solution that makes learning in large lectures easier. After reconvening and sharing our discoveries...
