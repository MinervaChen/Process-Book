			<h3> The Problem Statement</h3>
			<div class = "well"> 
			<h4>This was the beginning.</h4> Our team began by formulating many issues that a college student might come accross. Our initial choices were that carpool was difficult to find, that it was difficult to get from one side
			of campus to another, etc. Eventually, we decided upon the issue that it was difficult for many students to raise their hands during class. Or more specifically we addressed this: How can college students be in an environment where they will feel comfortable asking questions in a large lecture setting?
			<h4>Is this a real issue?</h4> Upon our decision, we decided to do some research to legitimize our problem statement. We discovered that one of the main reasons why students do not participate in class is because “many are shy or afraid to raise their hands”, according to 'The Teaching Center'. Furthermore, according to 'The Lecture Tools', “students are unlikely to answer a question if they fear their peers will judge them based on their answer”.
			<h4>Is this an issue for our demographic?</h4> Individually, our group members set out to interview other college students about this issue. After my interviews, I discovered that not all college students think the same way. Althought it is more difficult to ask problems in large lectures, not everybody believes that this problem directly inhibits their learning simply because there are other ways of obtaining information. However, if we are solely looking at the this problem, we find that people are more scared and insecure about asking questions in large lectures—and this fear could easily lead to confusion that the teacher would not know how to address the class with; in fact, the teacher would not know the class is confused in the first place if nobody asks questions. This changed my understanding of the design problem, because now we know that this is a valid problem that people struggle with, but it is also not considered an “extremely big deal” by many, so when we try to create solutions, we should not have the solution drastically change the way large lectures are done in general, but create a subtle solution that makes learning in large lectures easier. After reconvening and sharing our discoveries...
