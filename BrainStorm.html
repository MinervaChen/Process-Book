			<h3>The Brainstorm</h3>
			<div class = "well"> 
				<h4>We needed ideas.</h4> Collectively, our team formulated ideas together, and individually, we came up with 50 additional solutions to our problem. I drew 50 sketches for our problem. The process of coming up with ideas was strenuous. We had to think outside the box. Initially, when I would come up with about 10 ideas, I would simply get stuck. Every other idea that came to mind was simply the same thing I had already thought of. So I came up with some nonesense ideas to solve the problem. But then, I realized that these nonsense ideas, if scaled back a little bit were actually very interesting. 
				<h4>We reconvened and shared ideas.</h4> Some of our ideas overlapped. Some didn't. What made having lots and lots of ideas wonderful to begin with was that were never trapped. We always had another idea to fall back on, if some of them fell flat.
				We then organized our ideas. We split our ideas up into feasible, unfeasible, and possibly feasible ideas. This made it easy to choose which ones we could possibly use in our project. Each of us decided upon one idea to test out and reconsider.
				<h4>My Idea</h4> The idea that I decided to run with was called "The Confusion Scale". Essentially, it would be a scale that students could slide back and forth during lecture, recording their confusion as the class progressed.
